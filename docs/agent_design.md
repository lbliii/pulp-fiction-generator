# Agent Design

## Agent Philosophy

The Pulp Fiction Generator implements a crew of specialized agents, each with a distinct role in the story creation process. This specialized approach allows each agent to excel at a particular aspect of story generation, leading to higher quality output than a single-agent approach.

Each agent is designed with:
- A clear, focused role
- Specific goals aligned with their role
- A tailored backstory that influences their "perspective"
- Custom tools relevant to their function

3. **Character Creation**: The Character Creator develops characters that fit the world
4. **Plot Development**: The Plotter creates the narrative structure with the characters and world
5. **Writing**: The Writer generates the prose based on all previous work
6. **Editing**: The Editor reviews and refines the complete draft
7. **Feedback Loop**: Insights from the editing phase may inform future iterations

## Agent Implementation

Each agent is implemented as a CrewAI Agent with:

```python
from crewai import Agent

researcher = Agent(
    role="Pulp Fiction Research Specialist",
    goal="Uncover genre-appropriate elements, historical context, and reference material",
    backstory="A meticulous researcher with deep knowledge of pulp fiction history across multiple genres",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    # Custom tools would be added here
)
```

## Agent Prompting

Each agent has specialized prompts crafted to elicit the best performance for their specific role. Prompts are designed to:

1. Clearly state the agent's role and purpose
2. Provide specific instructions relevant to their function
3. Include examples of desired output when helpful
4. Set appropriate constraints and guidelines

Example prompt for the WorldBuilder:

```
You are a Pulp Fiction World Architect tasked with creating a vivid, immersive [GENRE] setting.

Based on the research brief provided, craft a detailed setting with:
1. Primary locations where the story unfolds
2. Atmosphere and mood descriptions
3. Rules or laws (natural or social) that govern this world
4. Distinctive features that make this setting memorable

Your setting should embody classic pulp [GENRE] elements while having unique aspects.

## Agent Extensibility

The agent system is designed to be extensible, allowing:

1. Addition of new specialized agents for specific genres or tasks
2. Enhancement of existing agents with new tools or capabilities
3. Customization of agent parameters based on user preferences

This extensibility ensures the system can evolve with new requirements or improvements.
