## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| LLM performance issues | Medium | High | Test with smaller models first, implement fallback strategies, optimize prompts |
| Poor quality output | Medium | High | Invest in prompt engineering, implement quality checks, add human feedback loop |
| Long generation times | High | Medium | Optimize prompts, implement caching, add progress reporting, use async where possible |
| Dependency issues | Low | Medium | Use UV for dependency management, maintain lock files, implement CI checks |
| Context limitations | Medium | Medium | Implement chunking strategies, optimize context usage, create summarization tools |
| Model compatibility | Medium | High | Abstract model interfaces, test with multiple versions, document compatibility |

### Contingency Plans
- Fallback to smaller models if performance is an issue
- Implement quality gates to reject poor outputs
- Add timeout and retry mechanisms for long-running generations
- Maintain compatibility with multiple LLM options
- Create a human-in-the-loop review option for critical quality issues

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The system can generate complete, coherent stories in multiple pulp fiction genres
2. Stories maintain consistent characters, settings, and plot across chapters
3. Generation time is acceptable (< 5 minutes per chapter on standard hardware)
4. Output quality is comparable to mid-tier human-written pulp fiction
5. The system can continue stories across multiple sessions
6. Documentation is complete and user-friendly
7. Users can customize story elements to their preferences
8. The system handles errors gracefully with helpful feedback
